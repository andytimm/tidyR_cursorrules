# tidyR_cursorrules
Iterative tracking of my cursorrules file for Tidyverse R.

[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), is an IDE that integrates LLM features well. A [.cursorrules file](https://dotcursorrules.com/) is a short prompt file included in project directories to shape the way the AI responds in a way that suits your preferences. 

My broad goal with this file is just to nudge the AI towards best practices for my work, like:
- Preferring modern tidyverse syntax and approaches to problems (there are plenty of times when data.table or base R are great, just not the focus here).
- A desire to build things that are elegant to work with and low cognitive load to read, not just functional.
- Adhering to stylistic preferences for good software engineering, especially from resources like [Grug](https://grugbrain.dev/) or [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201).
